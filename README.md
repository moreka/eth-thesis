# ETH Thesis Template

LaTeX template for writing a doctoral thesis at ETH Zürich. 

- Based on [KOMA-script](https://komascript.de/).
- Works well with 17cm by 24cm paper size.
- Inspired by [tuxu/ethz-thesis](https://github.com/tuxu/ethz-thesis)

## Usage

- Install a TeX distribution (TeXLive, MacTeX, MikTeX, ...)
- TODO: make the instructions clear for using as a template

## Sample PDF
